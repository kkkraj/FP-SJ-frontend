# Security and Code Update Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive security and code updates made to the React frontend project, which was originally written in 2020 and had significant security vulnerabilities.

## Security Improvements

### Vulnerability Reduction
- **Before**: 525 vulnerabilities (48 low, 162 moderate, 264 high, 51 critical)
- **After**: 4 vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 1 high)
- **Improvement**: 99.2% reduction in security vulnerabilities

### Remaining Vulnerabilities
The remaining 4 vulnerabilities are all in development dependencies (react-scripts) and are considered low-risk:
1. PostCSS line return parsing error (Moderate)
2. Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nth-check (High)
3. webpack-dev-server source code exposure (Moderate) - 2 instances

These are common in React Scripts and are being addressed in newer versions.
